      <h1>Rohingya people in Myanmar</h1>
      <p style="font-size:130%">
        For Many Years the Rohingya people have been oppressed, attacked and discriminated against by the Myanmar military and government. This has forced them to flee out of the country and become refugees. We believe that this is a violation of human rights and we need it to stop.
