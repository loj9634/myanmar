      <p>In 1948 Burma (now Myanmar) gained independence from the British. President Nu then declared that the Rohingya people aren’t a part of Myanmar’s 135 ethnic groups.<br>
        Throughout the decades the government has refused to accept Rohingyans as citizens of Myanmar, labelling them as refugees.<br>
        In 1977, violent attacks started against the Rohingyans. Many saw this as a tactic to “kick them out of the country” and joined by burning down homes and villages.<br>
        The 1982 citizenship law excluded and denied Rohingya citizenship, and effectively caused statelessness to the majority of the Rohingya.<br>
        To this day, progress towards Rohingyas gaining Myanmar citizenship are close to none.<br>
        We believe that the history of Myanmar has been plagued by discrimination and foreign involvement. This root of the crisis started in 1948 and not recently. The fact is that this minority has been silenced for many decades but now people are slowly recognising the voice and the problem.
