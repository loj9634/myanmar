      <p>In 1948 Burma (now Myanmar) gained independence from the British. President Nu then declared that the Rohingya people aren’t a part of Myanmar’s 135 ethnic groups.<br>
        Throughout the decades the government has refused to accept Rohingyans as citizens of Myanmar, labelling them as refugees.<br>
        In 1977, violent attacks started against the Rohingyans. Many saw this as a tactic to “kick them out of the country” and joined by burning down homes and villages.<br>
        The 1982 citizenship law excluded and denied Rohingya citizenship, and effectively caused statelessness to the majority of the Rohingya.<br>
        To this day, progress towards Rohingyas gaining Myanmar citizenship are close to none.
