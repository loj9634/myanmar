      <h1>A Human Right Violation</h1>
      <p>The Rohingya people have been systematically discriminated against and stateless. An example of this is the violation of Articles 6: Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law. (United Nations, 1948) The government of Myanmar has denied citizenship to the group, excluding them from censusâ€™ and refusing to recognise them as a group from Myanmar. Another human right violation that occurs within this crisis is Article 15.1: Everyone has a right to a nationality (United Nations, 1948)  The creation of the citizenship law in 1948 excluded Rohingya and 20 years later after the military seized power in 1962, introduced another law excluding even more groups including the Rohingya. Updated in 1982, the new citizenship law only recognises people of official races/groups as full citizens, which further limits the Rohingya people's basic rights. With Rohingya not being included in the law, they have been victims and faced constant discrimination due to their legal status and different laws prohibiting them from rights like freedom of movement. If one article in the UDHR is violated, it causes a domino effect, in which multiple other Rights are violated.</p>
