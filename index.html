      <p>For Many Years the Rohingya people have been oppressed, attacked and discriminated against by the Myanmar military and government. This has forced them to flee out of the country and become refugees. We believe that this is a massive and moderately unknown violation of human rights and we need it to stop.<br>
        <br>
        As youth living in New Zealand, we cannot even express what living in such an environment is like. However, we do know that this is a human rights violation and even though we are not able to stop such a massive issue ourselves, we are able to inform and voice the problem to raise awareness.
