      <h1>Our views</h1>
      <p>We believe that Myanmar’s Military and Government towards the Rohingya minority group are outrageous and a violation of human rights. Everyone has a right to a nationality and Myanmar’s Government has ignored this basic human right by denying them proper citizenship and excluding them from censuses and creating multiple laws that deny them citizenship as well. Furthermore, the Military has shot, tortured and raped many innocent Rohingya men, women and children.</p>
