      <h1>Our views</h1>
      <p>We believe that Myanmar’s Military and Government towards the Rohingya minority group are outrageous and a violation of human rights. Everyone has a right to a nationality and Myanmar’s Government has ignored this basic human right by denying them proper citizenship and excluding them from censuses and creating multiple laws that deny them citizenship as well. Furthermore, the Military has shot, tortured and raped many innocent Rohingya men, women and children.<br>
        <br>
        Sadly, the government of Myanmar cannot help but the government of Bangladesh is trying to help. Different non-governmental organizations are working with the government of Bangladesh to improve the situation. We provide these recommendations;

      <ul>
        <li><b>Safe housing:</b> As I have shed light on this problem multiple times before, something just as having four insulated and sturdy walls and a holeproof roof is enough to improve the living conditions and livelihoods of these Rohingya. Improving housing has many benefits such as; the decline of deadly and high risk diseases and improvement of mental health on parents as well as physical health on both parents and children just to name a few. With housing improved, it will take a huge amount of pressure off parents to provide their family with a safe and secure place to call home.</li>
        <li><b>International help:</b> As more and more Rohingyas flee Myanmar, they become stateless and are classified as refugees or asylum seekers. With countries accepting refugees as part of the refugee acceptance system, it shows that international governments are willing to give Rohingyas a free and safe life without their human rights stripped away. Countries like neighbouring Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Pakistan. First world countries like the United States, Australia and Canada are all countries that have accepted Rohingya as people. Collectively it shows countries are united as one and give people a second chance they deserve. I believe more first world countries need to play their part and accept Rohingya into their country.</li>
